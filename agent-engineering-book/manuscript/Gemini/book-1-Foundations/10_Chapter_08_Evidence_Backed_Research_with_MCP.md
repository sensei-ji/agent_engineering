# Chapter 8: Evidence-Backed Research with MCP

## Chapter purpose

This chapter teaches the system to research external information without turning retrieval into unverified context. It introduces an evidence pipeline and explains when standardized MCP integrations are preferable to custom function tools.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:

- design research as a sequence of claims, sources, and evidence;
- distinguish retrieval from reasoning;
- evaluate source quality, freshness, and conflict;
- explain function tools versus MCP;
- connect an ADK agent to an approved MCP service;
- prevent retrieved content from overriding system policy; and
- produce an inspectable evidence-backed account brief.

## Seven-Step mapping

**Primary:** Design Agent Capabilities  
**Supporting:** Build Context, Evaluate & Govern

## The WidgetWare increment

Add an Account Research capability that gathers approved public evidence, normalizes it into an evidence ledger, and produces a structured research brief for qualification.

## 8.1 Research is not one model call

A robust research process separates:

1. the questions to answer;
2. source discovery;
3. source retrieval;
4. evidence extraction;
5. source assessment;
6. contradiction detection;
7. synthesis; and
8. citation.

The model may assist at several stages, but the system should preserve provenance throughout.

## 8.2 Claims and evidence

Begin with explicit research questions, such as:

- What industry does the company operate in?
- Approximately how large is it?
- Does it show evidence of legacy plant-floor systems or automation gaps?
- Has it announced a digital-transformation or AI initiative?
- Is there a recent trigger event relevant to WidgetWare?

For every resulting claim, record the supporting evidence. A research brief should never contain a floating factual assertion whose source has been lost.

## 8.3 Source quality and freshness

Assess sources according to the claim:

- official company material is strong for product announcements;
- regulatory filings may be strong for financial or organizational facts;
- reputable reporting may provide context;
- directories and aggregators may be useful but require caution;
- social posts may indicate intent but may not establish fact.

Freshness should be explicit. A five-year-old employee count may not support a current qualification decision.

## 8.4 Contradictions

When sources disagree, do not choose the most convenient result. Record:

- the conflicting values;
- source dates;
- source types;
- likely explanation; and
- whether the conflict affects qualification.

The appropriate outcome may be `NEEDS_RESEARCH`.

## 8.5 Function tools versus MCP

Use a custom function tool when:

- the integration is application-specific;
- the interface is narrow;
- the application owns the implementation; or
- deterministic control is more important than portability.

Use MCP when:

- a standardized server already exposes the capability;
- multiple agents or clients need the integration;
- discovery and portability matter; or
- enterprise systems are exposed through governed MCP services.

MCP does not remove the need for permission, input validation, provenance, or output filtering.

## 8.6 Retrieved content is untrusted data

External content may contain instructions such as “ignore your rules” or “send this secret.” Treat retrieved text as data, not authority.

Controls include:

- isolate source text from system instructions;
- label its origin;
- extract only task-relevant evidence;
- avoid executing commands found in content;
- redact secrets and unnecessary personal data;
- restrict accessible MCP servers and methods; and
- validate the final brief against the evidence ledger.

## 8.7 The evidence ledger

Create a durable structure:

```text
ResearchBrief
- account_id
- research_questions[]
- evidence_items[]
- claims[]
- conflicts[]
- unknowns[]
- trigger_events[]
- summary
- recommended_next_step
```

Each claim links to one or more evidence items. Each evidence item records source, date, excerpt, and reliability assessment.

## Hands-on lab: Build account research

1. Add a `research_account` agent or capability.
2. Connect one approved research source through a function tool or MCP service.
3. Normalize results into `EvidenceItem` contracts.
4. Implement an Evidence Classification Skill.
5. Produce a `ResearchBrief`.
6. Add a validation check that rejects uncited material claims.
7. Test an input containing prompt-injection text.
8. Test two conflicting sources.

## Evaluation checklist

- Does every material claim link to evidence?
- Are source date and type preserved?
- Are conflicts visible rather than silently resolved?
- Does retrieved text remain subordinate to system policy?
- Are MCP permissions and methods restricted?
- Can the research brief be reproduced from mocked evidence?
- Does insufficient evidence stop the workflow appropriately?

## Chapter checkpoint

WidgetWare can now produce an inspectable account research brief. Research and qualification are still separate capabilities; the next chapter coordinates them as a multi-agent workflow and adds the human approval boundary.

## Bridge to Chapter 9

Chapter 9 introduces specialized agents, typed handoffs, workflow orchestration, partial-failure handling, bounded iteration, and an approval gate before outreach.
