# Chapter 11: Loop Engineering with ADK

## Chapter purpose

This chapter takes the evaluated, single-account WidgetWare workflow from Chapter 10 and turns it into a bounded, unattended process that works through a queue of accounts. The reader learns that this is a distinct engineering discipline — Loop Engineering — not a bigger version of orchestration, and builds it using ADK's own loop primitives rather than a bare `while True`.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:

- distinguish the inner agent loop ADK already runs from the outer engineered loop this chapter adds;
- explain why a working, evaluated workflow is still not a safe thing to run unattended;
- use ADK's `LoopAgent`, `max_iterations`, and `exit_loop` correctly and understand what they do and do not guarantee;
- design durable session state that survives a restart without reprocessing settled work;
- represent a loop's control decision as one of five explicit outcomes; and
- build a loop-ready checklist and apply it honestly to their own implementation.

## Seven-Step mapping

**Primary:** Engineer Loops  
**Supporting:** Build the Harness, Evaluate & Govern

## The WidgetWare increment

Wrap the Chapter 9–10 workflow, unchanged, in an ADK loop that reads a queue of candidate accounts, processes one at a time, checkpoints durable state after each meaningful stage, and stops with a named reason — instead of running once when a human asks.

## 11.1 What Chapter 10 didn't answer

Chapter 10 answers one question well: given one account, produce one evaluated, approved-or-rejected recommendation. A person can ask the WidgetWare agent to research Acme Manufacturing, and it will. But a system meant to run WidgetWare's actual sales-development motion has to answer questions the single-account workflow was never designed to answer:

- Where does the *next* account come from?
- Has this account already been processed in an earlier run?
- Should a failed research call be retried, and how many times before giving up?
- Should the system move on to another account, or stop entirely?
- When must a person intervene rather than the system deciding on its own?

None of these questions are about researching or qualifying one account better. They are questions about *control* — what happens around the workflow, not inside it — and Chapters 1 through 10 deliberately left them unanswered, because answering them requires the evaluated workflow Chapter 10 just finished building. The WidgetWare agent, as built through Chapter 10, is a genuine agent. It is not yet a loop.

## 11.2 The inner loop ADK already runs

Every ADK agent already executes an inner loop the moment it reasons: it observes the current input and state, decides whether to call a tool or respond, acts, and observes the result — repeating until it has enough to answer. This is real, it works, and Chapters 4 through 9 already built on top of it without needing to touch it directly.

```
Observe → Reason → Act → Observe
```

This chapter does not change that inner loop. It adds a different one, around it.

## 11.3 The outer loop this chapter adds

The outer loop is what decides, across many separate invocations of the workflow, what to work on next and whether to keep going:

```
Trigger
   ↓
Discover work
   ↓
Select the next eligible account
   ↓
Invoke the Chapter 9 workflow for that account
   ↓
Verify the outcome
   ↓
Persist state
   ↓
Continue, retry, stop, defer, or escalate
```

ADK gives this outer loop a real, named home: the `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` executes its sub-agents — here, the whole Research → Qualify → Review → Draft → Approve workflow from Chapter 9 — repeatedly, passing the same `InvocationContext` through each iteration so that state changes persist across iterations. It is deterministic in *how* it iterates, even though the sub-agents it iterates over reason with a model.

## 11.4 A loop is not `max_iterations` alone

It is tempting, having just finished an evaluated workflow, to wrap it in the smallest amount of ADK configuration that makes it run more than once:

```python
loop = LoopAgent(
    name="widgetware_batch",
    sub_agents=[workflow],
    max_iterations=50,
)
```

This runs. It is not yet an engineered loop. `max_iterations` bounds how many times the loop *can* run — it says nothing about which account comes next, whether one was already settled, whether the workflow's output was actually good, or what a person should see when something goes wrong. Every item on this list is something a real deployment cannot survive without, and none of them come from `max_iterations` alone:

- No work-selection policy — nothing says which account is next, or whether one was already handled.
- No durable state — an `InMemorySessionService` restart loses everything, including which accounts were already processed.
- No verification — a malformed or incomplete result is treated the same as a good one.
- No per-account attempt limit — one bad account can consume retries meant for the whole run.
- No cost or time budget — nothing bounds what the run actually costs.
- No escalation path — nothing routes an account the loop cannot resolve to a person.
- No recovery strategy — a restart has no way to resume, only to start over.

The principle worth carrying forward: **repetition creates a loop. State, verification, budgets, and control make it an engineered loop.** The rest of this chapter is that difference, built with ADK's real primitives.

## 11.5 Durable state with SessionService

ADK's `Session` already separates a durable record — its `state`, a scratchpad of serializable values — from the transient event stream of one conversation. Which `SessionService` implementation backs that session decides whether the record survives a restart:

- `InMemorySessionService` — state lives in process memory. Fine for a single lab run; gone the moment the process exits.
- `DatabaseSessionService` (or `VertexAiSessionService` in a managed deployment) — state is written durably and reloaded on restart.

Book 1 uses the persistent option for the batch loop's own bookkeeping, and keeps that bookkeeping simple and inspectable — two small structures, not a schema the reader has to reverse-engineer:

Run-level state:

- `run_id`, `status`, `started_at`
- `accounts_processed`, `successes`, `failures`
- `current_account_id`
- `stop_reason`

Per-account state:

- `account_id`, `status`, `attempts`
- `research_status`, `qualification_result`
- `draft_status`, `approval_required`

"Which stage is this account in" should never be a sentence buried in a model's response — it is one value from a small, explicit set, computable directly from session state, the same deterministic-versus-probabilistic boundary Chapter 1.4 already drew. A model may recommend a transition. Code decides whether it is allowed.

## 11.6 Explicit states and transitions

```
RECEIVED
  ↓
RESEARCHING
  ↓
RESEARCH_COMPLETE
  ↓
QUALIFYING
  ↓
REVIEW_REQUIRED
  ↓
DRAFT_READY
  ↓
AWAITING_APPROVAL
  ├── APPROVED
  ├── REJECTED
  └── BLOCKED
```

This is the same state machine Chapter 9.3 already built for one account. The loop does not replace it — it adds two states that only make sense once accounts are processed unattended, in a batch, rather than one at a time on request:

- `RETRY_PENDING` — a recoverable failure occurred and attempts remain.
- `NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW` — the loop is not authorized to resolve this account on its own.

An account that has failed twice and has one attempt left is in a different, nameable condition from one that has failed permanently. The session state should say which, not leave it implied by the absence of a result.

## 11.7 Verification before advancing

Every stage the loop advances past should be checked deterministically before the loop trusts it — the same principle Chapter 6 applied to the workflow's own output contract, now applied to the loop's own control flow:

- the workflow's output validates against its contract (Chapter 6);
- decisive claims carry evidence references (Chapter 8);
- this account has not already reached a settled status in an earlier run;
- the draft contains no claim the Evidence Reviewer did not approve (Chapter 9.5); and
- no external send action has occurred — Book 1 still contains no send tool.

A model-based judge that scores whether the *reasoning* was good is a real extension of this idea, but it belongs to Book 2's continuous-evaluation chapter. Book 1's loop verifies shape and policy compliance deterministically, for the same reason Chapter 10.5 kept schema checks and semantic evaluation in separate layers.

## 11.8 Budgets and the five-way decision

State every limit before the loop starts running, not after it has already spent the budget:

- maximum accounts per run;
- maximum attempts per account;
- maximum wall-clock runtime;
- maximum tool calls or estimated token cost; and
- maximum consecutive failures.

Any one of these being reached is a legitimate reason to stop, alongside simply running out of eligible accounts. After each account, the loop makes exactly one explicit decision — never an implicit fallthrough:

- **CONTINUE** — the account settled (approved, rejected, or cleanly disqualified); move to the next eligible account.
- **RETRY** — a recoverable failure occurred and attempts remain; requeue the account.
- **STOP** — a budget was reached, or no eligible accounts remain; end the run cleanly.
- **DEFER** — the account cannot proceed right now (a dependency is unavailable) but has not failed; leave it for the next run.
- **ESCALATE** — the account needs a decision the loop is not authorized to make; route it to `NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW` rather than retrying or discarding it.

ADK's own `exit_loop` tool and `EventActions.escalate` give the loop a real mechanism for ending the loop early — a sub-agent can signal "stop iterating" without the `LoopAgent` itself needing to inspect every field of every result to figure that out. What ADK's primitive does not do on its own is distinguish *why* the loop is stopping: that interpretation is WidgetWare's own code. The same `escalate` signal, paired with the account's session state, is what the loop's control-flow code reads to decide whether this is a clean STOP (budget reached, queue empty) or an ESCALATE (route to `NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW`) — the primitive hands back control; WidgetWare's decision logic assigns the reason.

## 11.9 Checkpoints and resume

A durable session is only useful if the loop actually writes to it at meaningful moments and actually reads it back on restart. Checkpoint after each of: an account being selected, research completing and passing verification, qualification completing, a draft being created, and the run's overall counters being updated. A process restarted against a `DatabaseSessionService`-backed session should read the last checkpoint and resume from there — it should not re-research a company whose profile is already saved, and it must not re-send anything, though Book 1 makes that guarantee structurally by never building a send tool in the first place rather than by trusting the loop to remember not to call one.

## 11.10 Human control does not change inside a loop

Every autonomy level from Chapter 1.3 still applies once work happens inside a loop instead of one account at a time on request. The loop does not get to renegotiate WidgetWare's approval requirements just because a person is not watching it run:

| Action | Authority |
|---|---|
| Research an account | automatic |
| Summarize evidence | automatic |
| Recommend a qualification status | automatic |
| Draft outreach | automatic |
| Send outreach | human approval required |
| Modify a CRM record | human approval required |
| Delete a business record | prohibited |

Everything above the line can run across as many accounts as the budget allows, unattended. Everything below it stops that account's progress at `AWAITING_APPROVAL` until a person acts — exactly what Chapter 9.6 already required for one account, now holding for every account the loop touches.

## 11.11 The loop-ready checklist

Before this loop is trusted to run unattended, it should answer yes to each of the following:

- Is there a defined goal for what the loop is trying to accomplish?
- Is there a clear source of work, and a policy for selecting from it?
- Is state durable — does it survive a restart?
- Are the states an account can be in explicit, not implied by prose?
- Does the loop checkpoint after meaningful stages, not only at the end?
- Is every stage verified deterministically before the loop trusts it?
- Is there an attempt limit per account?
- Are there time, cost, and tool-call budgets?
- Are there explicit stop conditions, checked every iteration?
- Is there a path to escalate to a person, distinct from simply failing?
- Does the run produce a report a person can audit after the fact?
- Is there a way for an operator to stop the loop from outside it?

A system that cannot answer yes to all twelve is not yet an engineered loop, whatever else it does well.

## Hands-on lab: Build the batch loop

Implement:

- `src/widgetware_sdr/loop/account_queue.py` — work discovery and the work-selection policy: the next account whose status is `RECEIVED` or `RETRY_PENDING`, never one already settled;
- `src/widgetware_sdr/loop/budget.py` — the budget dataclass and a stop-condition check run once per iteration, before any account is selected;
- `src/widgetware_sdr/loop/decision.py` — a function returning exactly one of `CONTINUE` / `RETRY` / `STOP` / `DEFER` / `ESCALATE`, given an account's state and the current budget check;
- `src/widgetware_sdr/loop/run_report.py` — a report every run produces, always including its `stop_reason` and per-status totals;
- a `LoopAgent` wired to the Chapter 9 workflow, backed by a persistent `SessionService`; and
- a small seed queue of at least four accounts, at least one deliberately outside WidgetWare's ICP.

Add scenario tests for: a fresh account gets selected and a settled one doesn't; a recoverable failure retries up to the configured limit and no further; a restarted run resumes from saved session state instead of reprocessing; the loop stops at both the account limit and a budget limit; and every run's report names a stop reason.

## Evaluation checklist

- Does the loop select a new account and skip a settled one correctly?
- Does session state survive a simulated restart?
- Is every stage verified before the loop advances past it?
- Does a recoverable failure retry only up to its configured limit?
- Does the loop stop at every budget it declares, not only the account limit?
- Does every run produce a report naming its stop reason?
- Does anything in the loop send an external message automatically? (It must not.)

## Chapter checkpoint

WidgetWare can now work through a queue of accounts unattended, within limits it states in advance, and it stops for a reason it can name. Nothing about the single-account workflow from Chapters 4 through 10 changed — this chapter added everything *around* it.

## Bridge to the Book 1 conclusion

The conclusion consolidates what this system can now do across all eleven chapters, and identifies what must change when one bounded, looping application becomes an enterprise agent platform.
