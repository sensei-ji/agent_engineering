# Chapter 7: Tool Engineering

## Chapter purpose

This chapter connects model reasoning to external capabilities through narrow, typed, permissioned tools. The reader learns that a tool is not merely a function exposed to a model; it is a security and reliability boundary.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:

- decide when a capability should be implemented as a tool;
- design clear tool names, descriptions, and schemas;
- validate tool inputs and normalize outputs;
- apply least privilege and isolation;
- handle timeouts, retries, and errors explicitly;
- mock tools for evaluation; and
- prevent tool output from bypassing evidence and policy rules.

## Seven-Step mapping

**Primary:** Design Agent Capabilities  
**Supporting:** Build the Harness, Evaluate & Govern

## The WidgetWare increment

Add controlled tools for retrieving internal account records, product facts, and approved business configuration. The system still does not use open web research or external message delivery.

## 7.1 When a tool is appropriate

A model should not pretend to know information that belongs in a system of record. Use a tool when the application needs to:

- retrieve current data;
- perform a deterministic calculation;
- interact with an external system;
- access a protected resource;
- execute a side effect; or
- obtain information too large or dynamic for static context.

Do not use a tool for behavior that can be expressed as a simple deterministic function within the application, unless isolation or reuse justifies it.

## 7.2 Tool descriptions are part of control

The model selects tools based on their names and descriptions. A good description states:

- what the tool does;
- when it should be used;
- when it should not be used;
- required inputs;
- important limitations; and
- whether it has side effects.

Avoid vague tools such as `get_data`. Prefer `get_account_profile(account_id)`.

## 7.3 Input schemas

Use narrow, typed inputs. Validate before execution.

For example:

```text
get_account_profile
- account_id: non-empty string
- include_fields: optional approved enumeration
```

Do not allow arbitrary query text to reach a database or command shell. The tool owns translation from safe parameters to the underlying operation.

## 7.4 Output normalization

Return compact, predictable results. A tool result should indicate:

- success or failure;
- normalized data;
- source identity;
- retrieval time;
- warnings;
- retryability; and
- error category.

Large raw payloads consume context and expose irrelevant data. Normalize before returning information to the model.

## 7.5 Least privilege

Each tool should receive only the permission it requires. A read-only account lookup should not use credentials capable of updating CRM data. Book 1 can demonstrate this principle with separate interfaces even when the backing data is local.

Least privilege applies to:

- cloud IAM;
- service credentials;
- file access;
- network access;
- data fields; and
- allowed operations.

## 7.6 Failures are part of the contract

Tools fail. Design for:

- invalid input;
- not found;
- permission denied;
- timeout;
- dependency unavailable;
- rate limit;
- malformed upstream data; and
- partial result.

The model should not convert a failed lookup into a fabricated answer. A retry should occur only when the error is retryable and within a bounded policy.

## 7.7 Side effects require stronger controls

A read tool and a write tool should not be treated equally. Side-effecting tools require:

- idempotency where possible;
- explicit confirmation;
- audit information;
- narrow scope;
- rollback or compensation strategy; and
- policy checks outside the model.

Book 1 intentionally omits the send-message tool. The architecture will represent approval without exposing autonomous outreach execution.

## 7.8 Tool testing

Test tools independently from agents:

- valid input;
- invalid input;
- missing record;
- dependency failure;
- permission failure;
- deterministic output shape; and
- redaction of prohibited fields.

Then test the agent with mock tools so that evaluation is reproducible.

## Hands-on lab: Add internal data tools

Implement:

- `get_account_profile(account_id)`;
- `get_widgetware_product(product_id)`;
- `get_icp_policy()`; and
- a deterministic `calculate_fit_score()` helper that remains outside model reasoning.

Attach the read tools to the qualification agent. Update the contract so that every retrieved fact receives an evidence identifier.

## Evaluation checklist

- Does every tool have a single clear responsibility?
- Are inputs typed and validated?
- Are permissions narrower than the underlying platform account?
- Are outputs compact and sourced?
- Are failures explicit and non-fabricating?
- Can the agent be evaluated with tool mocks?
- Are side effects absent or guarded?

## Chapter checkpoint

The agent can now obtain trusted internal data through controlled interfaces. Its next challenge is external evidence: researching a company without confusing web content, tool output, inference, and instruction.

## Bridge to Chapter 8

Chapter 8 builds an evidence-backed research pipeline and introduces MCP as a standardized integration mechanism. The focus is provenance, source quality, and resistance to malicious or irrelevant content.
