# Chapter 2: Sessions, State, and Long-Term Memory

## Chapter purpose

This chapter gives WidgetWare real memory: the ability to recognize a returning user, recall relevant prior interactions, and do so without leaking one user's information into another user's session or retaining information indefinitely. The reader learns that memory is not a longer conversation history — it is a designed, scoped, and governed system in its own right.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:

- distinguish a session's state from an agent's long-term memory;
- explain how ADK's `SessionService` and Agent Platform Memory Bank relate, and where the boundary between them sits;
- design what gets extracted into long-term memory, and what should never be extracted;
- scope memory per user so it cannot cross a tenant boundary;
- apply a retention and deletion policy; and
- test that a stale or contradicted memory does not silently override current evidence.

## Seven-Step mapping

**Primary:** Build Context  
**Supporting:** Build the Harness, Engineer Loops

## The WidgetWare increment

Give the WidgetWare agent identity-scoped session persistence and long-term memory: it should recognize a returning SDR user, recall which accounts they have already worked, and never surface one user's account notes to another user.

## 2.1 Session state versus long-term memory

Book 1 already used ADK's `Session` — the container for one conversation's event history and its `state`, a scratchpad of serializable values. Chapter 11's loop used a persistent `SessionService` so that batch progress survived a restart. That is session-scoped: it belongs to one run, for one purpose, and it is not designed to answer "what do we already know about this user, across every session they've ever had."

Long-term memory is a different, complementary system. ADK integrates with **Agent Platform Memory Bank** for persistent, identity-scoped memory: an agent equipped with the `PreloadMemoryTool` and deployed to **Agent Runtime** uses `VertexAiMemoryBankService` by default, and can generate memories from selected session events and retrieve relevant memories across sessions, scoped by user. The distinction matters operationally, not just conceptually — session state disappears (or persists) with the session's own service configuration; memory persists deliberately, across sessions, because the application chose, at a specific point, to submit that session for extraction.

## 2.2 What belongs in memory, and what does not

Not every fact in a session deserves to become a memory. A useful rule: memory should hold information that changes how a *future* interaction should be handled, not a transcript of what happened in this one.

Worth extracting:

- "This user prefers a one-paragraph summary before the full research brief."
- "This user has already worked Acme Manufacturing twice this quarter; do not reintroduce it as new."
- "This user's territory is North American manufacturing accounts."

Not worth extracting, and actively risky to extract:

- the full text of a researched account brief (that belongs in the knowledge plane, Chapter 3, retrievable on demand — duplicating it into memory creates two copies that can drift apart);
- anything containing another user's data, even in passing;
- a one-off correction that doesn't generalize ("skip this specific account" is a task instruction, not a durable preference); and
- unverified inferences promoted to memory as if they were settled facts — memory should carry the same fact/inference/hypothesis discipline Chapter 1 of Book 1 established for everything else.

## 2.3 Writing and searching memory

The write path is deliberate, not automatic on every turn: at a meaningful point — typically the end of a session — the application decides that session is worth submitting, and calls the memory service's add-to-memory operation with its contents. What happens next is a division of labor, not a single decision: the application controls *which* sessions get submitted at all, and the memory service controls *what gets extracted* from within a submitted session — it is not the model, mid-conversation, unilaterally deciding what to remember. The read path is a search, scoped to the current user, run before or during a new session so the agent's instructions can be grounded in what is already known about this specific person, not the whole memory store.

```python
# Illustrative shape, not a complete implementation.
await memory_service.async_add_session_to_memory(session)

results = await memory_service.async_search_memory(
    user_id=current_user_id,
    query="WidgetWare account preferences and history",
)
```

The `user_id` scope in the search call is not a convenience parameter. It is the boundary that prevents one user's memory from ever entering another user's context — the enterprise-scale form of the least-privilege principle Book 1, Chapter 7 applied to tools.

## 2.4 Memory can be wrong, stale, or contradicted

A memory written last quarter — "this account's champion is the VP of Operations" — can become false without anyone updating it. Design for this from the start, not as a later patch:

- attach a timestamp to every memory the same way Book 1's evidence items carry `retrieved_at`;
- treat memory as a *hint to verify*, not a fact to restate as current without checking; and
- when current evidence (Chapter 3's retrieval, or fresh research) contradicts a memory, surface the conflict the same way Book 1's evidence ledger surfaced conflicting sources — never silently prefer the newer one without saying so.

A system that treats every old memory as still true is not remembering. It is accumulating stale certainty.

## 2.5 Retention and deletion

Memory that is useful indefinitely is also memory that accumulates risk indefinitely. WidgetWare's memory policy should state, explicitly:

- how long a memory is retained before it expires or requires reconfirmation;
- what happens when a user's access is revoked — memory scoped to that user must become unreachable, not merely unreferenced;
- how a user or an administrator can request that specific memories be deleted; and
- that memory extraction never captures secrets, credentials, or another user's data, even if the session transcript briefly contained them.

## 2.6 Testing a memory system

Memory is a probabilistic extraction process feeding a system that should behave deterministically about scope. Test both halves:

- **extraction quality** — does a representative session produce the memories a person would expect, and not extract noise;
- **scope enforcement** — a search for User A's memory must never return anything extracted from User B's session, tested with an actual cross-user query, not merely asserted; and
- **staleness handling** — a memory contradicted by fresh evidence should be flagged, not silently trusted.

## Hands-on lab: Add memory to the WidgetWare agent

Implement:

- `src/widgetware_sdr/memory/service_config.py` — configure a persistent `SessionService` and the Agent Platform Memory Bank-backed memory service;
- `src/widgetware_sdr/memory/extraction_policy.py` — the rules for what is and is not written to memory;
- an update to the qualification agent's instructions so it consults memory, scoped to the current user, before starting research; and
- tests for: cross-user isolation, a memory correctly surfacing a user's prior work on an account, and a stale memory being flagged rather than trusted outright.

## Evaluation checklist

- Is session state kept separate from long-term memory, both conceptually and in code?
- Does every memory write pass through an explicit extraction policy, not an unfiltered dump of the session?
- Does a cross-user memory search test actually attempt the leak and confirm it fails?
- Is there a retention and deletion policy, not just a storage mechanism?
- Does the system distinguish a memory from a currently verified fact?

## Chapter checkpoint

WidgetWare can now recognize a returning user and recall relevant, scoped history without treating old information as automatically current. The knowledge plane still lacks the other half of memory: access to enterprise information the system was never told directly.

## Bridge to Chapter 3

Memory answers "what do we already know about this user." It does not answer "what does the enterprise already know about this account." Chapter 3 connects WidgetWare to retrieval over a real knowledge collection.
