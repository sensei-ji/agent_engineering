## Running the golden solution

```bash
cd golden-solution
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
./scripts/check.sh
```

Expected: `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, and `pytest` (3 tests) all pass.

## Facilitator checklist

- [ ] Give Antigravity (or simulate) both the unscoped task ("build the entire application") and the properly scoped one from §2.6 — the comparison is the point, not either output alone
- [ ] Confirm every participant's `./scripts/check.sh` (or equivalent) passes before homework is assigned
- [ ] Flag the Kahoot #7 discussion (scope creep temptation) explicitly — it recurs in almost every class from here on
